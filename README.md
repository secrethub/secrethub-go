### Examples

For details on all functionality of this library, see the [GoDoc][godoc] documentation.

Below are a few simple examples:

#### Read Secrets
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/secrethub/secrethub-go/pkg/secrethub"
)

func main() {
    client, _ := secrethub.NewClient()
    secret, _ := client.Secrets().ReadString("path/to/db/pass")
    fmt.Println(secret)
    // Output: wFc16W#96N1$
}
```

#### Write Secrets
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/secrethub/secrethub-go/pkg/secrethub"
)

func main() {
    client, _ := secrethub.NewClient()
    _, _ = client.Secrets().Write("path/to/secret", []byte("password123"))
}
```

#### Generate Secrets
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/secrethub/secrethub-go/pkg/randchar"
    "github.com/secrethub/secrethub-go/pkg/secrethub"
)

func main() {
    client, _ := secrethub.NewClient()
    data, _ := randchar.Generate(30)
    _, _ = client.Secrets().Write("path/to/secret", data)
}
```

### Credential

To use the SecretHub Go client, you need to provide a credential for your __SecretHub__ account.
You can create a free developer account by [signing up through the CLI](https://secrethub.io/docs/getting-started/).

After signup, the credential is located at `$HOME/.secrethub/credential` by default.
`secrethub.NewClient()` automatically uses this credential.
